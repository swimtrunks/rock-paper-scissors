# rock-paper-scissors
a simple "rock paper scissors" script that I made to implement what i knew about javascript programming at the time.<br>
I am currently learning more to make this script run a bit more cleanly and will return to it to remove all the console logs and replace them with return functions.
There will be a HTML and CSS compononet eventually but as of right now this is will be the start of this project.
